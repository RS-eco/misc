git add .gitattributes

######

## Delete all commit history in Github

#Deleting the .git folder may cause problems in your git repository. If you want to delete all your commit history but keep the code in its current state, it is very safe to do it as in the following:

# Checkout
git checkout --orphan latest_branch

# Add all the files
git add -A

# Commit the changes
git commit -am "Upload files"

# Delete the branch
git branch -D main

# Rename the current branch to master
git branch -m main

# Finally, force update your repository
git push -f origin main

# PS: this will not keep your old commit history around

# For good houskeeping, after those commands, a nice, might be a good idea:
git gc --aggressive --prune=all 

######

## Other Github commands

# Find where your master commit points to

git show main

# Show list of branches

git branch

# Create new branch

git branch newbranch

# Check recent commit of new branch

git show newbranch

# Shows same latest commit as git show master, as it is just a copy of the master branch

# You can also create branches from previous commits

git branch planet master^ # Does not work, why???

git branch planet main~3

# Creates a new branch and then checks it out

git checkout -b planet
git commit
git commit

git checkout -b saturn

# Switch branch

git checkout planet

# Create new branch, checkout and commit

git branch jupiter
git checkout jupiter
git commit
git commit

# See all branches of a repository

tree .git/refs

# What is in those folders:

cat .git/refs/heads/newbranch

# It's a hash / commit ID
